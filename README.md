# csv2xlsx
Simple (and not most elegant) tool providing conversion of csv to xslx using Apache POI

Tool also converts csv file encodings. (Output temp file)
Byte order mark is not added for encodings (so far)

Older versions of Apache POI are added to gradle because I needed Java 1.5 compatibility.

Newer versions of Apache POI also work.
